# `1-events`

The events are the executable identifiers of the graph.

Each event has a unique identifier and a label. Events can be categorized into two types: `Input` and `Output`.

- `Input` events: Executable by the user, similar to commands or API calls.
- `Output` events: Contain data created by the user or generated by executing `Input` events.

In this [example](main.tdcr), we have the following events:
```
(i: Input)[?]

(o: Output)[0]
```

The `i` event is an `Input` event, denoted by the `?`, and the `o` event is an `Output` event with the value `0`.

In the next examples, we will explore the different types of data that can be used in the events.
