# `ex-bad-typing`

This folder contains multiple examples of how the interpreter handles type errors.

| Example | Expected Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| [`0.tdcr`](0.tdcr) | Event `s` not found in the template graph. |
| [`1.tdcr`](1.tdcr) | Event label `Action` has different data types specified. |
| [`2.tdcr`](2.tdcr) | Different number of exported events between the template and its application. |
| [`3.tdcr`](3.tdcr) | Duplicate event ids in the main graph. |
| [`4.tdcr`](4.tdcr) | Same as `1.tdcr`. |
