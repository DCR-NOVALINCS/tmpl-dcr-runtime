# `3-marking`

One of the properties of the events is the marking. 
An marking indicates the current state of the event. 

The event marking contains the following information:
- `included`, i.e the event is included.
- `pending`, i.e the event is pending from execution.
- `executed`, i.e the event is already executed.

This information is important to see which events can be executed in anytime of the execution (see later in [here](../6-enabledness/README.md)).

You can set the default marking of the events in the modelling process.
Consider the following example:

```
(a: A)[?]
%(b: B)[?: Number]
!(c: C)[?: String]
âœ“(d: D)[?: Boolean]
```

where the marking of the events are:

| Event | Included? | Pending? | Executed? |
| ----- | --------- | -------- | --------- |
| `a`   | *true*    | *false*  | *false*   |
| `b`   | *false*   | *false*  | *false*   |
| `c`   | *true*    | *true*   | *false*   |
| `d`   | *true*    | *false*  | *true*    |


**Note:** if is not specified, the default marking of an event is included, not pending and not executed.
