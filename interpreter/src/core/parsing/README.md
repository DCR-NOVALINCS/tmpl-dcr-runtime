# Parsing Module

The parsing module is responsible for parsing the input source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST). The module is implemented in the `parsing` package and consists of the following components:

- `lexer`: The lexer is responsible for tokenizing the input source code. It reads the source code character by character and generates a stream of tokens. The lexer is implemented in the `lexer` package.

- `parser`: The parser is responsible for parsing the token stream generated by the lexer into an AST. The parser is implemented in the `parser` package.
