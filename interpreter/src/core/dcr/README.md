# DCR Module

The DCR module is responsible for applying the semantics of the Dynamic Condition Response Graphs (DCR Graphs) to the program.
The module consists of the following components:

| File                                   | Description                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`errors.ml`](errors.ml)               | Defines error handling utilities for the DCR module.                              |
| [`evaluation.ml`](evaluation.ml)       | The evaluation module is responsible for evaluating values of the the DCR graph.  |
| [`helper`]()                           | Provides helper functions for the DCR module.                                     |
| [`instantiation.ml`](instantiation.ml) | The instantiation module is responsible for instantiating templates in DCR graph. |
| [`runtime.ml`](runtime.ml)             | The runtime module is responsible for running the DCR graph.                      |
